## amuse-bouche

is what I call my little web-facing side projects.

* [eoe-roller](/amuse-bouche/eoe-roller) (2018)

   a web application to handle dice pools for the Fantasy Flight Games' RPG _Edge of the Empire_. Those dice are surprisingly expensive.
 
 * [mtg-deck-display](/amuse-bouche/mtg-deck-display) (2019)
 
   an application that pulls _Magic: The Gathering_ card images and information for all the cards in your deck. This is purely for your own enjoyment and pleasure.
